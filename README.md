# Malicious-PixelCode
This research process we begin with a C++ payload responsible for command and control communication. After compiling it into an EXE the binary is converted into Pixel Code MP4 using a Python based tool. The generated Pixel Code video is then uploaded to YouTube and its URL is embedded inside a C++ loader.
