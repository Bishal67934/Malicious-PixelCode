# 🎨 Malicious-PixelCode - Securely Store Executables in Images

## 🏷️ Overview
Malicious PixelCode is a security research project that shows how to encode executable files into pixel data. This technique allows you to store these files inside images or videos. A lightweight loader retrieves the media file, reconstructs the original binary, and runs it in memory. This project highlights unconventional ways to deliver data.

## 🔥 Features
- **Covert Execution**: Run executables from images or videos.
- **Simple Loader**: Easily retrieves and executes the original binary.
- **Security Research Focus**: Understand and explore unconventional data delivery methods.
